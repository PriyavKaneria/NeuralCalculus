<!-- Culrav 2023 just ended, annual cultural fest of MNNIT Allahabad. It was 3 days of fun events. I am in pre-final year and this time around did not get myself involved in any management or technical activity to fully participate and spectate the events.
The last day went by with everyone spending their time with their friends and juniors and seniors. Some were involved in committees and others were having girlfriends. It was me who felt alone. Not the first time though, I had tackled this feeling lots of times before. This time it was different. Everytime I got the feeling that my decisions, rules and contraints made by myself get me into situations that might make me feel bad emotions temporarily but will eventually prove their worth. I cannot live without a plan. But this time I thought ~why~ how me?-->

I thought if people of all religions and beliefs knew about the characteristics of a godly individual, and also that how can we become one. Why was no one following it? Don't people want to become god. Do their short sightedness not see the powers of god beyond the fiction of miracles and superstitions.
People on asking might say they would love to become god. But why can't they even live their daily life by abiding that. People lack to become ideal and they have accepted it. Even god might accept the fact that everyone need not be the same.

But then, what about an individual who was born and brought up with these characteristics. We might not notice him/her among us. How does he/she decide whether to become like others or not? Is it wrong to be right? Don't know
