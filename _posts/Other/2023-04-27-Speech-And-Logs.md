I was thinking...

Yes, that's were it all started. There is an analogy to how we tend to write rubbish when we write more. When we write a lot, chances are most of it will have to be rubbish or non-useful. That's simple probability. Outliers are rare by the [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) of everything by nature. And good stuff is always in the outliers. There will be very few authors who have all of their books bestsellers if they have a lot of books written by them. Same logic applies to other places as well.

There are people who write something everyday. Or want to. But writing everyday does not mean whatever you are writing everyday is useful or "good-content" for a reader to read. Most newsletters gain audience by one or two awesome posts and most of the remaining posts are there to keep the audience stuck and maintain the streak of "quality-content" every "some"day. Hence the solution is to do it less. Write less. Speak less.

This applies to me as well, though in a different way. I noticed *(and have been told a lot of times ðŸ˜…)* that I speak to early, or that I speak too much, or that I don't listen to the person speaking. But on deeper thought the issue with me is not that exactly. It's not that I'm not listening to them, I am listening and that I can be sure as I have always tried to understand what the person is speaking. Then what might be the problem. Why am I speaking in between a lot?

I found out that it was because I was thinking a lot. And in my subconscious mind I was putting my thoughts into words and speaking them so as to log them out. I.e. while thinking, if I get a thought which seems important or a doubt or something, I need to log it (store it in some way) somewhere. Why? because I know that as I think a lot, in just the next few seconds chances are I might forget that thought. So where do I store it? not in my mind as that's where I'm unable to *(while thinking)*. Then why not other's minds? And so I speak it out to make sure I don't forget. But then that is a problem for the speaker who feels I am not listening.

The solution is to think less. Keeping the mind calm and not think until the time comes. Instead of running the thinking thread separately in the background while listening, let the listening thread be the only process running. Think after listening. And Speak after thinking.
