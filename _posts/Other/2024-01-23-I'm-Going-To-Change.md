I judge a book by it's cover  
but still give it a read  
the judgement did not affect the decision  
because I know I'm going to change  

I'm not scared to open up  
I tell some people everything  
it might ruin my personality  
but it's fine, I'm going to change  

I want to do a lot of things  
many feel the same in life  
I bring myself to do it at the moment  
as I fear that I'm going to change  

I would love to know more people  
to understand the why behind their thought  
it's not a one time process  
seeing that everyone is going to change  

Nothing in existence is permanent  
neither absolute nor defined  
still it keeps me curious  
I know I have to change
