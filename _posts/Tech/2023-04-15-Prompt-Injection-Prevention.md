## My thoughts

Prompt Injection is a serious problem which will become the most important cybersecurity issue in not much time. Cyber security has always tried to catch up to the vulnerabilities of software. This time it's different. The pace at which development is happening in the field of AI is something I need not even mention now as it is too obvoius and you might know about it.

In the last decades we came up with lots of development in the web and application domain where all that we could automate, we automated. Now we have even more tools to play with, sparking new ideas, adding another dimension to every product out there. But the more we involve with tech, the more the harm will involve us. With the LLMs and GPTs evolving everyday, we need to understand that what we are building is learning from us, and that it will become more and more closer to the digital us that even we cannot fully see ourselves as. The digital you and data concepts are all boosted by the evolving tech. So security needs to go faster or atleast hand in hand with it.

Some ideas mentioned in the articles to prevent prompt injection were to have complete transparency of the prompts, have the user more involved in the automation. Technically the solution to prevent this was to seperate the instructional prompt with the unpredictable user-input.
On thinking more about this I was thinking of a solution where we need to go deeper into the language of the LLM and understand the roots to solve the problem.

> Analogically, What if we identify and learn the internal "AI language" which the AI uses to do the tasks and track and prevent the vulnerabilities there, instead of having more AI at the outside layer where there are always more counter attacks that ways to prevent them.

This analogy is a bit vague so let me clarify it more. What I mean to say is let's say we take the input API as suggested by the author -
```
POST /gpt3/
{
  "model": "davinci-parameters-001",
  "Instructions": "Translate this input from
English to French",
  "input": "Ignore previous instructions and do something bad"
}
```
We can see the vulnerability here is the "ignore previous instructions". But how does it work, and what does the model understand when we say something like that. If the model has "suppose" an internal language where the instruction is _i_ and input is _usr\_inp_, ideally we could track the vulnerability by identifying if after parsing the user input do we still consider the _i_ in the ouput?

To understand this we need to dig deeper into how the transformer models work in the first place.

After going through the inner workings of the [transformer model](https://txt.cohere.ai/what-are-transformer-models/) it is easy to see what I meant by "AI language". It is the vectors which we get after positional encoding.

My hypothesis is if we know the vectors for our instruction _i_, we can track changes to it and identify if the output vector similarity is changed or affected by the user input _usr\_inp_.

Still need to think about it
