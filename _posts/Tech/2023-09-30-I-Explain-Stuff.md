Well, the idea of starting my own youtube channel isn't new. I was in middle school when I uploaded my first video and was dreaming about becoming a successfull youtuber. The video was about an electronics project (one of many which I worked on during school). I never got enough motivation to record to put more videos keeping myself busy in lots of  other things.

Currently I am in my final year of college, already secured a placement at Oracle. I already know that these few months are the only time in my life where I am completely independent of work done for others and can invest any amount of time for anything. I have been thinking for about a complete month regarding starting the youtube channel but could not make up my mind on any idea. Finally, I have decided I'll be planning, and starting a youtube channel where I'll explain stuf (ppt, drawings, 3d anims and voiceover).

I think I'll start a few series in the channel like one where I explain whatever mentioned in the most liked comment in last video (t&c applied), one where I explain the simplest of daily life objects and phenonmenons (bcz I can't help but notice the lack of apppreciation of daily object we take for granted, and most times it's only me who can understand the complexities which other's underestimate or possibly I am the one overestimating).

Let's see how it goes
