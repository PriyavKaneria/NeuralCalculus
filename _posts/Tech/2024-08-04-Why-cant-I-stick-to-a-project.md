I cannot stick to a project. At least that's what I feel like. It's never happened that I have left a project without even building an MVP. Till now I have worked on several "revolutionary" (as it always seems like) projects but they never came out of the alpha or beta stage.

It's not like I haven't shipped anything. There's lots of projects which I have actually completed and shipped (HitNRoll, LocalLock, lots of websites, college event websites, npm packages etc) but like any normal person it's not an easy task to maintain these. So they stay at v1 for eternity.

Other projects get up to MVP and then get lesser and lesser priority upon newer ideas which I get. Every time it's better than the last (so it seems).

Ideating more, building more, and even almost shipping the MVP has given me a lot of [necessary survival skills]({% link _posts/life/2024-04-16-Reflex-vs-Instinct.md %}). My ideas are getting better, more robust and every time I work on something, I stick to it longer.

I also feel inside that it's this sticking that actually matters. you know how like doing is more important than saying, same way sticking is sometimes more important than jumping around. It's like one of those debates - is it better to learn a lot of skills or learn a lot of "some skill". I'm a polymath so you know which side i'm arguing, but you get the point.

Even if someday I decide to stick to a project, how do I know it's the one I should stick to. I know there is no definite answer but that does not stop me from still asking the question. It's good food for thought and it might me one of those things you unlock with more XP. wisdom. It can also be the case that once I deeply see PMF for a project, I might really stick to it. None of my projects have got there yet so the possibility is still there. With demand will come the supply.
