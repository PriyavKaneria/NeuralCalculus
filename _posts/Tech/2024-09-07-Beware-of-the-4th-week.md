you are just about to go to sleep. you are having a good shit. you're bored from job/college work.

and you get an Idea! a unique concept that you haven't thought about till now. It will have some interesting implementation challenges and will also fulfill your curiosity.

while you continue your job you're doing, you get more and better plan and ideas related to it. The chain of thought can't be broken.
you finish your job and start working on it.

it's the first week and you've setup your project, prompted a lot of the base ideas to claude/chatgpt/cursor whatever. You have an MVP in mind for the first iteration, and you start coding.

it's the second week and you have the MVP built. You're trying to get some important functionality working and probably sitting on a tangent you need to solve before working on the main goal. The tangent is also interesting and challenging.

it's the third week you have it all working, somehow. Probably not what you planned or expected to build but something better on the same lines. Now that you have the project, you work no making the best implementation of the main goal, which involves some static cumbersome process. You slowly start doing it.

it's the dreaded fourth week, you know inside you are nearly out of motivation and this cumbersome process is annoying. You still gather your will and complete the cumbersome process, you have your project ready. You show it to someone, social media wherever and get feedback. You get good critical feedback, which can improve the project very much. But you've already satisfied yourself. You have no motivation to satisfy other's who most probably are not even going to use it or try it. This is the peak. Not necessary to climb and overcome, but something you should be aware of.

the more time that goes by doing something, the harder it is for the mind to work on it. It's very similar to how LLMs have limited context windows, our minds also have. It's just that our mind stores A LOT of context in some kind of permanent storage si it can bring up different context's if it wants to. But for a specific task (chat) our mind can only focus so much, after which it slowly starts to hallucinate.

btw it is this hallucination, when you'll probably get your next idea to work on. So it's also something to look out for.
