depends a lot on what you want to do but importantly

### number 1. prioritizing the mvp & deciding what consists of the mvp
- what are the minimum requirements you want to fulfill (realizing them and fixing in your mind)
- should be acheivable in max about 2 weeks

### number 2. breaking it down into a roadmap
- all this, "maybe" but ideally "should not" need any kind of written or vizualization. what i mean is people think that it's best to write down the roadmap for clarity and memory as well as make a viz etc; but in almost 90% cases all this is not required
- If it's a solo project/task you yourself should be so much clear with the roadmap in mind you need not write it to remember. that's also an indicator of how well do you want the task to be done/realized
- understanding the dependency flow in your mind regarding the tasks is necessary and improves with experience

### number 3. let the task sink in, let it not break causality
- action bears fruits of results
- don't overhype/overshare the outcomes
- share the journey, the problems and solutions
- otherwise you are sure to lose motivation, because the dopamine of the outcome has already been released without realization of the outcome

### number 4. use the right tools
- use the internet, surf and explore.
- utilize search keywords like "... reddit" "... research" etc
- get some idea of the "good enough" way to do the subtask
- do not oversurf, finding the best way will waste more time and you'll lose on learnings. good enough is all you need
- use ai, explain the problem well and you'll get better solutions

### number 5. last one. keep executing with consistensy
- make subtasks in a way that each one comes with it's little curiosity/excitement of unknowns
- adapt the tasks and add your own creativity to whatever you are doing, never make a strict decision regarding anything. you might even change the complete stack in between.
- don't let it overburn you and/or your motivation. you'll know when you are close, stop right then. do something else. go out

this is just the tip of the iceberg. everyone is on a different ship so fill in the details yourself

thought about all this because one of my polymath moot [@indiraschka](https://x.com/indiraschka) was discussing about the same
