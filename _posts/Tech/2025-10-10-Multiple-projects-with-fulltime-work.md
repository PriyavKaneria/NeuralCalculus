working on multiple projects while working at a job full time has some less known benefits

it keeps me going. I get excited about my projects after work because i love them. I get excited about my work after projects because that gives me validation, quick wins. exactly the same reason why I have 6+ projects ongoing at the same time.

I don't want to leave any project. I never do. But the stack gets full so I have to. It is for the better mostly, and over the years the quality of output after and at which I leave projects has tended towards completion. I am inclined towards shipping things before leaving them to make sure I don't ignore a potential banger.

anyway coming back to jobs,
the reason is same for why the best ideas come when you are bored and why right before exams you feel all the fun that is missed out on. my mind works most creatively when it is bored. everything is done better with creativity. and hence my partially boring work gives me enough creativity to fuel my projects. and when the projects get boring, I do better at work.

i am never really losing
