With the whether changing more quickly than my crush, the mosquitoes are there all the time now. While being annoyed by them I thought of a unique way that has not been thought before to resolve the issue -

> Also yeah mosquito bed nets are the best and only feasable solution to this problem (where it is possible to use that is to say). And repellents never seem to do the job for the whole night. Evolution!

Anyway, I thought

1. what is it that these pesky insects want? Blood, right. 
2. do I have any issue in their taking my blood (miniscule amount)? Not really
3. what issues do I have?
   1. Them being near me -> Sound
   2. Them poking me with their needles (which is not the main issue but) which results into itches
   3. Them possibly bringing diseases to me -> Obviously Bad

So let's not kill them, neither will be leave them hungry. Let's feed them ourselves so they don't need to do anything to us. This solves all 3 problems right.

I looked into it then. No good results on the internet!

I think I'll have to try this out myself. Might be a good experiment.

## What I'm planning

Blood dries very quickly. So I'll mix it in some water, put a pint of it in a bottle cap and keep it outside to first observe whether they even prefer fastfood or not.
If this goes as planned then I'll compare whether those who are already inside my room will prefer me or the pint.
