## Phases of work life balance

1. 0% Work - 100% Life

    The day goes by doing unproductive tasks with unfruitful outcomes. Even if you have targets to achieve you tend to procrastinate a lot more and do stuff that gives you happiness for the shorter duration of time. Running after quick fun over long term goals.

2. 100% Work - 0% Life

    The day goes by doing work and you don't have time for working on personal goals and interests. Ironically, you also tend to gain motivation and creative ideas for working on thinking about if you did not have to do work you would be doing it. But you don't have time for it. This phase is good and is necessary for a short period of time to bring out new and innovative ideas which come only out of boredom.

3. 50% Work - 50% Life

    This is probably the best time maintain a balance between work and life. You are able to do your work and also have time for your personal goals and interests. Work hours get you the motivation to work on your personal projects and also make sure that you are not losing your productivity by doing unproductive tasks.

Also in no means am I suggesting to live an ideal life. Shot term fun tasks are also good ways to come out of the boredom and stress of the work. But it is important to maintain a balance between the two by managing the time spent well.
