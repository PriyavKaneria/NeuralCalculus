"Sangati ka asar" [hindi]

Water fills it's vessel and takes it's shape. Humans all of them behave the same way. Their lifestyle, decisions, behaviour as a whole depends on those whoom they spend time with.

But everyone has a different rate of changing shape. It's what I call "Accomplice coefficient". Some people tend to take in their surroundings quite quickly, while some tend to be the one's which change other's behaviours (and generally do not change themselves easily). The lower the value the more adaptable you are. A higher accomplice coefficient value correlated with other bad human emotions and behaviour.

Need to think about some way to quantify it.
