title: Peaks of noise and a Spike of silence

In noise we find the peaks are what matters or what are observed.

In silence, even a tiny spike or murmur is something that is thought upon.

A person who has done lots of bad stuff in his life, will be in spotlight (in trouble) when he goes beyond a big threshold of worseness of his deeds. Someone who has taken care of not indulging in such activities will be asked for even the slightest of bad deed he showcases.

A person who has lots of achievements in his career, a really big acheivement is required for gaining any attention. Someone with no achievements gains attention with a single low value one as well.

This is all due to context. If we know a single data value we cannot classify it to a qualitative property without context of nearbuy data values same as in data analysis mathematics. 

Not something that is really important to know but like other important facts of life it is interesting to know this and keeping in mind the possible outcomes whatever the side you fall upon.
