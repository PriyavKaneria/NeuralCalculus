Analyse your day. Analyse your time.
How much did you spend on screen? Was it more than what you wanted?
Now close your eyes and think of some work that you can do that does not involve screen. Were you able to identify any such task? If not, give it 5-10 more minutes.

How difficult was it to find some work not related to screen?

I'm not talking about tasks which involve others. Spending time with friends is good, but not what I'm talking about here. Assume everyone other than you is on screen spending their time doing whatever they want. And now you who were also doing the same - scrolling around a ton of media, suddenly turn off your mobile due to the realisation of high screen time. So you decide to not use your phone for now. And now you close your eyes to think of something to do. And you start thinking, the only thing you do on your own, for your own self without a screen in front of your eyes is sleep!.

Spending time alone without a screen. Is this even possible? I certainly experienced this when travelling alone for 30+ hrs in a train with my phone, either discharged or on charging. You start thinking. Then you start overthinking. Then you either start feeling happy and sleep, or you start feeling depressed and not being able to sleep, wait and think until your phone is charged. And it's the later most of the time. But why so? Because we have forgotten to spend time with ourselves? Not sure. But whatever it is, we need to change.

All the above is generally true for people involved in IT. Anyway what was I saying btw? Oh "time"! Yeah, so people everywhere around you will start by telling you one thing. That there is not much time! That you never know when something bad or good might happen, and that if you won't do something now it will probably be too late. And I agree with them. So why this article, it is because there is one additional thing you should realize. Why is it that there is not much time? Are you really utilizing your complete day to the best. On reading this now thoughts start come into your head - I don't need to be 100% productive, No human can live a life grinding like crazy, It's not good for you, Leisure time is necessary etc. But that is because you are preassumptious about what I am trying to say. I am saying if you really want to do something, you probably have a lot of time in your day which you can use to do that. Scrolling media for 10 mins will get your mind to same level of happiness if not more, than if you scrolled for an hour or two. That's the time I am talking about which you can probably use. Now apply the multiplication which they tell to do until it's in years. And you'll be amazed by the number of years you waste scrolling.

If you feel the same way, just remember - You don't need to think that you need a lot of time for you to have lot of time, because you already have. You need to be awawre that you don't have much time to use the time you have so that you have enough time to achieve your goals. Now that's a lot of time! ðŸ˜†
