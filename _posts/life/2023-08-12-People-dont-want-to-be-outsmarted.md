### People were evolved to be self-centered. Not just me or you, it's everyone. But how and to what extent are we self-centered is a good question to ask yourself

I won't say that I have met a lot of people in my life, because I have met people who are expert at that; But everyone I meet, I or probably everyone judge them. Well, I don't judge their character or such things, but I judge them in very broad and general terms. Their personality, how they act, react and talk with younger, pals and elders in different situations (keeping context in mind).

I analyze the behaviour and myself everytime I discover something new or fascinating. Trying to find ways to improve myself. But in last few days I discovered, or you can say more like realized this fact. That, people want to meet and connect with smart people, but don't like it when the same people outsmart them. I felt this was ironical, but after some thought it made sense. By default itself, people don't like to be outsmarted, espessialy if the person is the same age or younger. The fact that people want to meet and connect with smart people is only because they can or might need to in the future make use of that person for his/her benefit. If they cannot use a person, the person has no value to them via smartness. Then the value shifts to or lies in emotional as well as physical bonds. Yeah use might be a harsh word to use in this sense but that's the fact. Most people use people. Those who won't use you (hopefully) are going to be your closest friends or family or exceptionally some really good fellow.
