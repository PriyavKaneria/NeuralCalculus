if it seems like it's too good to be true, it probably is
if it seems like it's addicting, it probably is

chor apne aap ko kabhi chor nahi bolta,
ek addicted insaan kabhi apne aap ko addicted nahi maanta

if you are not emotionally strong enough to never even try stuff, then you are not strong enough to come out of it's dependency
where stuff implying drugs, smoking, vaping, drinking, lust, etc AND smartphones, OTT, tv, any technology you can't live without

i cannot stop you from doing stuff. i am myself addicted to a few (smartphone and lust). but i can make you aware that you are emotionally weak. you cannot survive on your own, and it's exponentially difficult to de-addict yourself from some of the more dangerous of the stuff

minimize the number of addictions and you'll live a long and healthy life. rest is on you to understand, my job is done here.
