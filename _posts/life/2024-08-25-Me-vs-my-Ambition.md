Like every other person, there are multiple personalities I live by. Most of them are fun.
But who I'm talking about rn is my ambition. And that guy is tough to deal with. It wants to step over everyone, it acts as if everyone is mean and that everyone is to be used as a means and not the reason. And these are all straight violation of my principles.

But I cannot let it be under my complete control, because it's the reason why I'm where I am and why I always take the path towards growth. The heartful part of me embraces everyone's existence and actions, including myself and my ambition.

If you are someone I find cool, I look up to or get interested in talking with (a lot of people covered tbh), then there is a chance you'll catch a glimpse of my ambition while talking to you. I hope you like it.
