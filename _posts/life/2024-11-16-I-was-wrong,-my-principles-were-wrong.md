Accept, Clarify, Adapt is what I believed in. Acceptance is necessary for change, clarity is necessary for the right analysis and adaptation is what makes you stronger.

I was wrong, not completely, but some of my thought processes were.
Somehow even after caring about everyone and everything, I was being selfish. how? let me explain

I speak a lot. way too much than I need to. so according to my principles I explain everything in utmost detail. no abstraction at all. to everyone. in my terms "to give clarity" for their understanding. But did I ever think about whether they wanted to understand? no. did I think about what will be their thoughts and after thoughts on what I'm saying (with much important context missing) and how that will affect my trust, image, personality? never. that's the problem. I thought that I was putting myself in their shoes but I wasn't. it was cope.

another problem was I somehow care about what everyone thinks about me but again with my perspective. that's actually the worst. either not give af about what other's think or do it right and understand what they will think from their perspective. 

### alright so what next? what do I learn? how do I adapt?

- stop giving unnecessary detail (i have learnt this lesson multiple times but still repeat like a fool)
- it's not wrong to hide information from people
- think about things actually from other's perspectives

I hope I change
