bhasad - भसड़ • (bhasaṛ), slang meaning mess, ruckus, chaos

everyone's life has has ups and downs. those downs in hindi slang, we call as bhasad. so what about it? bhasad is a form of energy. It's a unique form of energy that has no direct relation to the physical world. It is an emotional energy, one can say.

Any form of energy follows the laws of energy. let's validate -
> energy can neither be created nor destroyed

- checks out. people usually in language use the word more generally like you made this bhasad etc. but what the intention actually is is you caused the bhasad. the bhasad was transfered from some person to you. it did not spawn out of nowhere and neither will it go away on it's own
- bhasad is transfered via convection, conduction, radiation
    - convection - people when faced a problem either solve the problem, or just talk about it to others. so as to share the pain. and it actually works. the bhasad get's shared equally until there is an equilibrium.
        > ideally you can just share you bhasad with enough people and then after equilibrium you won't even care and move on
    - conduction - people can cause problems for you. intentionally or non-intentionally people pile up on their own bhasad, and cause bhasad for others. as the energy is transfered, it is not necessary to be in the same form. the bhasad might have changed it's shape specific to you. this is also the fastest way of stacking up on bhasad.
        > ideally stay silent with people who are piling up on bhasad. it's difficult at times but learn to manage and only allow conduction when absolutely necessary
    - radiation - when you stay around people who have lots of bhasad, just by staying with them you can get some bhasad of your own. it all makes sense once you think about people with friends with bad habits, people who are good but with bad people doing crimes etc.
        > ideally stay compeletely away from people with high bhasad. this is the easiest form of bhasad to stay away from but at the same time the most important. if you do not set your priorities right, you won't even feel the slow bhasad you are piling up on and it will all come down together

if one can understand and master this form of energy that is bhasad, they can live a minimum bhasad life. \
do not expect a bhasad free life as a thing without any form of energy is not a thing at all.

### what happens when one piles up on bhasad?

think of bhasad energy like a clay ball. that clay ball as the problem gets more clearer, the clay ball start taking shape. shape of a spear. \
this bhasad energy piles up and becomes a sharp spear. but the spear size depends on person to person. the more a person can keep it in, the bigger and more dangerous the spear gets. once it reaches the max limit of the person, it is thrown. thrown towards anything and everything that is in it's path. piercing through many things, leaving some clay residues and at the end sticking to someone. smushed into a clay ball again. \
the cycle repeats

throwing small spears and handling them promperly is recommended for a managable bhasad.
