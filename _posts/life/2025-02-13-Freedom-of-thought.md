![the meaning of life when asked to gpt4o in one word, gives liberation](/assets/img/posts/meaning-of-life.png){: w="700" h="400" .shadow}

when asked why does one earn money? they say freedom.\
when asked what is the most basic necessity of a constitution? it is freedom.

freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom of profession, freedom to do whatever you want with life, financial freedom etc.\
all these are what come to your mind. but have you given a thought about your thoughts?

# where the mind is running free, and the world is held afar

You already know by now that your mind has become a slave. People are self-conscious enough to know it is bad for them. Some are trying to fix it my reducing screen time, some are doing physical activities, some are reading books...

But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the dying creativity of your mind. You may be learning new skills, but are you learning the skill to think? Your mind is like a pet animal whom you have never left alone, never let go of the leash to wander about, to jump around, fly about and explore the vast infinity of the universe.

You have a lot of time to be honest, to think. To think of nothing about your work, nothing about your relationships, nothing about your problems. Just think about something new, something you have never thought of, some corner of the dimensionless space of your mind which you did not even know existed. How? You'd ask. Good question. It's not easy. actually, let's first discuss about something else.

# meditation has become a joke

have you ever meditated? I'd argue not. majority of people who think that sitting in the asana, closing your eyes in a quite environment, with no sensory inputs, they are meditating. I don't believe in that. Meditation is all about your thoughts. I'm not talking about thinking positive things, attracting/manifesting reality all that bs (bs in this context). Meditation is about letting your thoughts free, not trying to control what you think, instead let the mind think on it's own. Your mind is the most powerful matter in this universe that not even math and science can understand completely, and you are not using it to it's full potential.

When thought about it, that is precisely why we sit in those asanas, close our eyes and reduce sensory inputs. All of those things make it much easier for you to let the mind free. Once you know the why, it all makes sense. I don't even know if this is true but I believe all the legends who have lived on this planet in every domain/profession have been able to achieve this rather regularly in their own different ways.

For me, for about 15-30 mins before I sleep, I am able to get into this state once every few days or so. Sometimes the context leaks from whatever I was doing right before sleeping, but most times, once in this state, thoughts jump around. Random sparks of ideas, ways to solve problems come up. problems which I'm not even closely related to. I keep a pen and a notebook right beside me when I sleep, if any of those thought processes are worth remembering, I'll sacrifice that state, wake up, quickly jot down keywords (even in the dark, I don't care about line spacing as long as it's legible the next day), then go to sleep in next few minutes.

Find your own flow state, your own conditions where you can experience the FREEDOM OF THOUGHT.
