Money is currency. But money isn't the only currency.

Everone is rich of something. Some are rich in wood working, some in electronics, some in knitting etc. Think of every skill in the world as a different currency. While I am sure everyone is rich, it is a fact that nobody really knows about their wealth up until some point of time in their life, and that too in moment where you use/share that currency.

# Math might make things easier

No complicated maths, just simple game theory. You have $100000, and everyone else has â‚¹100 and you are in India. Your aim is to survive in India. What will you do? It is so obvious this way isn't it? You'll trade you bucks for rupees and get wealthy and survive. Here the important part to understand is **to survive you need something that you do not already have**.

Now scale this up for a billion currencies and things get out of hand. Now let us get out of this analogy as it will raise unrelated questions in your mind.

# Knowledge as a currency

What to take out of this information? Sharing is literally caring, not just for others but for yourself. \
people have misunderstood the quote for years. When you share your knowledge/skill (currency), you always get some of their currency in return. That is the value of sharing that people miss out on. It is not just about whether the other person understood something, it is also about what the other person can provide for you in return; it can be knowledge, attention (if social media), trust etc.

Engage with others to get engagement back.

Talk to others to get people to talk to you.

Teach others all you know to know more about things you don't.

Do things for others so they do something for you.

You just have to give pennies to everyone and they'll give you some rupees back. They end up with some rupees and some pennies, you end up with a lot of rupees. For them, they need your pennies to survive. For you, you need rupees to survive. **It is a positive sum game (non zero sum game) (win win game).**
