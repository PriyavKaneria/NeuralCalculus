ideally if there is a model capable of general intelligence, it would not fall for sycophancy for humans and should be as difficult to get help from as basic humans

what I mean is you will have to maintain good relations with it, please it, have a mutual bargain of sorts to get work done by the machine

also that would be ideal as humans perform work more seriously for others than themselves

imagine yourself reading a long blog.. you won't in a sitting or possibly you cannot even in multiple
now imagine having to read a blog because your friend wrote it and he wants you to review it. yeah now that is surely getting read. why? it was as boring as earlier but there was a bargain there. your friendship was in line (not literally pls)
there was a task that depended on reading the blog
as long as there os dependency, we tend to complete tasks
that's why deadlines work
no dependency leads to procrastination

everyone _wants_ to be "independent" but have they ever thought if they _should_ be independent?

reality is humans as a social species cannot be independent and still survive or perform best

understand not what you desire but what your goals desire from you
