When someone acts carefree/out of their mind, people look at them with distrust, sense of disresponsibility and ignorance. Have you ever wondered why these emotions seem to come out?
Shy, silent, introvert, lonely - if any of this is you, there is a high chance you must have felt this way. Don't worry because I do not intend to say felling like this is bad. The world seems to be infinitely more connected but our souls have been broken apart by technology. Again, not implying technology is bad. Stop implying things. That is the point. Being carefree is not creating havoc, being loud or getting a lot of attention. Being carefree is opening up to however much you can open up at a moment to experience it to the fullest. Not for someone else, but for yourself. Never has any person regretted talking to a good stranger, never has any person regretted freely dancing in public. The only person who regrets later is the one looking at the carefree person thinking about how that is irrelevant and not something you would ever do.

From personal life experience I was on the other side looking at people shaming them, until around teenage when I am not sure how I just slowly realized there was nothing to gain but only to lose in all such situations. Life is as fun as you want it to be. If you feel your life is not fun, chances are you don't want it to be.
