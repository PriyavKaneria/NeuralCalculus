imagine a tree
if you climb it you get to experience a view no one has seen, fruits so delicious that you will cry, respect from people you got inspiration from, everything. it feels like heaven.

to climb this tree you need to do one thing only. climb. yes, step on whatever you could step on, any branch even if that branch breaks, hang on to something and climb.

but once you climb it, it is sure that you will fall from it at any point of time from the top. and when you fall you will feel extreme pain and suffering. it feels like hell. but when you look up, your vision is now blessed with a superpower - you can see hundreds of such trees. you want to climb them all but instead you spend your life teaching others how to climb. even though you don't tell them what happens after.

because you know that when your students fall back, they will not resent whatever they went through when they actually look up and see the world noone else can see without the vision
