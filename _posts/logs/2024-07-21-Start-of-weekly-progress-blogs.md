title: Start of weekly progress blogs 
categories: [logs]

From this week onwards I'm starting my own journey of documenting my weekly progress on whatever I learn, whatever I apply, whatever I do that is memorable.
Non-memorable stuff I do not want here anyway.

This is inspired by a lot of people from twitter, especially [danb](https://x.com/dnbt777), [sachin](https://x.com/version0chiro).

I have a specific format in mind (might, or in fact will change with time)
