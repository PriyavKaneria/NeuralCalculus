## What I pre-planned

- Work on atman
  - Train for sine wave regression without spatial attention
- Buy domain priyavkaneria.com for my blogs
- Setup new flat and buy all necessary supplies
  - To start cooking food here
  - Proper internet connection
  - Cleaning and other survival stuff

## What new did I learn

- Learnt more about regression in depth, what works and what not
- Discussed the ideas with Suhas and colleagues at work to get more insights
- Somehow actually learnt something in work training
  - Oracle Visual Builder with Ojet
  - Making microservices with spectre
- We can use old router to act like an extender for wifi boost or wireless ethernet connection

## Where/How did I implement it

- Tried multiple iteration and approaches on sine wave regression but still stuck on flat functions with larger networks
- Bought the domain priyavkaneria.com for approx Rs.800 per year for 10 years. Got a good deal with coupon I found on reddit
- Setup the free TPLink router 2.4Ghz with WDS bridging for reliable ethernet in my bedroom connected to a better 5Ghz router in hall

## Any memorable moments of the week

- Met Aaryan, a young (18yo) trainer working on his own company. just pure cracked energy
- Cooked first lunch with sister (bhindi + aloo, dahi and chappati), oiishi desu
- bought major groceries, appliances, gas etc and identified good stores near me
