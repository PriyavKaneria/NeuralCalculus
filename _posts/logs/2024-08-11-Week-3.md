## What I pre-planned

- atman : sine wave regression improvement
  - implement network config generation script
  - get out of stuck local minima

## What new did I learn

- understood how the architecture affects the output function
- matplotlib is slow for multiprocessor plotting, lots of errors so shifted to pyqt6
- if I seed some good weights and biases with added noise then training is much faster
- multitrain batches of children like genetic algorithms

## Where/How did I implement it

- simpler networks with tanh activation works best for sine wave
- pyqt6 is overkill but made code a lot faster to run
- got to 45% accuracy with 15 generations of 10 children each

## Any memorable moments of the week

- broke my toenail while playing football
- played some really good badminton
