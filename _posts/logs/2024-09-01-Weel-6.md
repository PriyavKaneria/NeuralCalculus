## What I pre-planned

- to complete all my major experiments on game of life
- complete portfolio hero section overlay in wasm
- work on animations for section transition to blog
- think about projects page
- actually fix some bugs assigned at work

## What new did I learn

- used porter for first time to get parcel from agency
- deployment on cloudflare pages is better than figuring out how to build static for complex projects
- learnt about dragon curves and animated dragon curves
- integrating and injecting custom js and html in jekyll
- communication between parents and iframes using `window.postMessage`

## Where/How did I implement it

- got an awesome idea for projects page after lot of thinking and prompting
- idea required stats data about all my projects (which I was curious about otherwise also)
- implemented a side project [CodeStats](https://github.com/PriyavKaneria/CodeStats) for analyzing any set of repositories and visualizing them on cli

## Any memorable moments of the week

- all weekend plans were cancelled due to rains
- found an awesome piano piece `The Interstellar Experience` (sounds as good as it sounds)
