## What I pre-planned

- complete portfolio page with projects page
- restart daily gym (failed)

## What new did I learn

- need to post more after I ship project
- can fetch, calculate and analyze github statistics which I wanted myself
- rich CLI UI for [CodeStats](https://github.com/PriyavKaneria/CodeStats)
- what a [scrunchie](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1832037608207323556) is
- multi-threading >> async io [blog](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1832315108099330258)
- motivation curves

## Where/How did I implement it

- started and shipped CodeStats in a day
- making fantasy maps was [cool](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/) but too much effort for projects page
- got better simpler idea for projects page
  - done with the list view, styles and formatting

## Any memorable moments of the week

- khairatabad ganpati maharaja darshan
- lumbini park and lots of ice-cream
- best football of my life, won by 21-9
- moved on (iykyk)
