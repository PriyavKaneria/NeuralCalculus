## What I pre-planned

- launch [priyavkaneria.com](https://priyavkaneria.com)
- launch [projects.priyavkaneria.com](https://projects.priyavkaneria.com)
- deploy custom analytics other than cloudflare due to data retention issue
- reevaluate on what's next
- travel back to hyd

## What new did I learn

- umami analytics is very easy to use and deploy (got it up and running in 5 mins)
- used neon sql hosting for the analytics, good exp, easy & quick to setup
- elon & his team caught a heavy rocket booster and reminded everyone how legendary he is
- got to a record low self-confidence and came back better

## Where/How did I implement it

- launched stuff and wrote a writeup on it (yet to post)
