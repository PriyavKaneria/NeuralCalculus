## What I pre-planned

- enjoy my week with family
- that's about it

## What new did I learn

- [writes and write-nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html)
- learnt more dishes
    - chole bhature
    - kadhi
    - lapsi (difficulty level: insane)
- scraping twitter is tricky
- joined replyguy/acc
    - replying more is actually fun, engaging and good way to use X
- not use website of services that have better apps (zoomcar fkup)

## Where/How did I implement it

- all you can buy experience for parents in malls and everywhere
    - this felt better than gifts and all
- cooked some good food with family
- worked on making a chrome extension idea for gif management

## Any memorable moments of the week

- 500 days streak on duolingo
- zoomcar fkup (~4k)
- Srisailam jyotirling + statue of equality trip
- made an amazing marwadi uncle friend just by random talking
