## What I pre-planned

- DocuCap single cam panorama implementation
  - 3 ESP communication mvp
- synapse v0 showcase
  - v1 plans
- spam museum memes haha

## What new did I learn

- [Homography](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/dab/tutorial_homography.html) and OpenCV stitching implementation
- lot's of new learning in work stuff
- learnt how to make paneer butter masala, South Indian tomato chutney and garlic bread at home
- esp32 softAP and STA communication system, async websockets and webservers
- antv6 - G6 graphing library is very cool, just not enough documentation or community (in eng at least)

## Where/How did I implement it

- successfully stitched panorama for single camera 20+ frames for 160deg FOV [image](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1862130679645114727)
- simple communication [implemented](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1862811266407936232) between 3 ESPs'
- implemented v0 of Synapse using G6
  - planned next features and timeline
- implemented VB code for some fundamental analysis on stocks

## Any memorable moments of the week

- super fun one day road trip to Anathagiri hills
  - almost explored ourselves to a new path, but returned last minute due to bear roar sounds 0*0
  - calm and nice view point, surreal
- it was fun implementing the hardware communication config with AI discussions
