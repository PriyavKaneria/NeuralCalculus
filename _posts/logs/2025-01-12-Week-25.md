## What I pre-planned

- Synapse
    - work on search optimization
    - faster rendering
    - basic features and v1 launch
- DocuCap
    - get back where I left of
    - probably try SIP or a different communication protocol
- work stuff
    - pitch in new proposal and polish the idea

## What new did I learn

- very insightful stuff about reinforcement learning from [naklecha's blog](https://naklecha.notion.site/a-reinforcement-learning-guide)
    - even though I knew about it beforehand, lots of tiny details were useful
- good thoughts about breaking down and understanding oneself by [danb](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-get-good-at-debugging-your-mind/). highly relatable
- interestingly for Synapse, even with 500 nodes and lot more edges linking them, the thing I had to optimize was state management, rerendering and layout optimizations
    - i expected search across all the nodes would be something I might have to work on but even brute force right now is instant
    - should make you think about what actually is useful out there and what seems to be useful
- SIP protocol is useful for realtime communications and stuff like VoIP, which I don't really need for DocuCap
- there can be uniportal, biportals and even triportals and more. [some good stuff with math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcfaHfDCEc)
- there is a git switch command apparently

## Where/How did I implement it

- added and completed all basic features for Synapse
    - sent for review and once shipped people can install and atleast start collecting their history data locally
- Instead of having master slave with X-YZ, tried out straight XYZ slave communication and good enough results
    - still need to reduce buffer communication RTT of about 200ms to less than 100ms for atleast 10FPS
- wrote my thoughts on [bhasad as a form of energy](/_posts/life/2025-01-07-Bhasad-can-neither-be-created-nor-destroyed.md)
- shipped [genesis500.vercel.app](https://genesis500.vercel.app) for my first 500 followeres


## Any memorable moments of the week

- all nighter poker first time, won with beginner's luck
