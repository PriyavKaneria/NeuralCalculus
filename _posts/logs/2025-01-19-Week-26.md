## What I pre-planned

- explore new ideas
- just think and think and think, improve thinking
- try to communicate better
- finish Silicon Valley series
- DocuCap
    - better fps with new commuication protocol
    - order antenna and parts for next steps
    - start with stitching and calibrating part
- Synapse might go live so launch that

## What new did I learn

- lots of fun things about startups and stuff from the series
- UDP communication in python and optimizing communication of websockets
- a random math fact [i'm proud of](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1879522980986073182)
- some new math experimentation idea out of scribbling and thinking

## Where/How did I implement it

- new pfp, this time something custom made using bad apple character. i'm happy with this pfp
- better tweets, not much thought
- UDP server implementation for better fps
    - was able to achieve stable 15fps and upto 20fps without losing resolution using udp + websockets instead of direct tcp
- got serious about building something with the bois, let's see where it goes
- trying out the math idea in code, if there is anything interesting in the implementation
- slowly growing in followers

## Any memorable moments of the week

- makarsankranti - flew kite with friends and lots of fun
