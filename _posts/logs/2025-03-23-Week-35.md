## What I pre-planned

- complete pending work and get on track
- focus, focus, focus, lock in
- get research work action items
- prioritize docucap progress over introspector

## What new did I learn

- i love buildings, architecture and photos of geometry
- soldering pins to board, charging lipo and monitoring
- gradio UI for introspector
- overall something has changed, I feel way more mature, thoughtful and smarter
    - not sure what happened but I am able to focus and do stuff very fast

## Where/How did I implement it

- got a lot of progress at work, got appreciation
- got the framework for making and testing the stitching software ready for docucap
- vibe-coded the hopefully final phase of introspector, ready to test and debug

## Any memorable moments of the week

- ran a 10k marathon under fun at work Oracle
    - marathon was somehow 8.7k so me and the boys went for the extra mile just to get to 10k
    - pace was also good - 6:40/km and was able to stay in the zone without breaks for 3km twice
- on the same day, played fun board games (avalon, coup, catan) with tanishq, pratik, ayush and hardik
    - 2hrs of basketball in the best weather possible (cold wind, just about to rain weather)
