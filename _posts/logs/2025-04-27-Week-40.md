## What I pre-planned

- game dev continue
- think and plan about productivity app idea I got
- finalize and release prototypes at work

## What new did I learn

- it is much faster to prototype a fully playable game with AI tools
- discussing critical things about a idea with close friends and family is a must before getting to implementation
    - however much the process of building it might feel rewarding

## Where/How did I implement it

- save the leaf - game dev
    - added saws for added difficulty
    - UI stuff like score, wind meter etc
    - basic pause menu, game over menu and restart functionality
    - first build and playtest from family and friends
        - sadly its bad, not intuitive
        - too difficult for start and not inducing fun
        - too much failure and not a rewarding success
    - might either come back or ditch this game
- one shotted the base of productivity app using warp AI agent
    - warp is pretty good

## Any memorable moments of the week

- got hurt while playing basketball in left hand
    - got scared as if there were a fracture, it might involve screw surgery
    - luckily xray was fine and splint is enough
- got a new apple keyboard and magic mouse from work - honestly they are so bad
- fun time spent playing badminton and Uno - No mercy with friends
    - went for a nice gedi and half-nighter
