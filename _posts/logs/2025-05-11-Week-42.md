- UX is very important so more meta learning on that

## Where/How did I implement it

    - tried getting screen lock unlock status (failed partially)
    - but got a native custom module working on expo
    - made another public module for using usage stats API
    - rewrote the backend calculation from scratch to take the new data into consideration
    - onboarding flow basic and dashboard page completed

## Any memorable moments of the week
