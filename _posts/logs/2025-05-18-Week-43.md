## What I pre-planned

- spotlight presentation at work
- work on Output - productivity tracker app
- training artis model for simple ML based image generation

## What new did I learn

- got an insane thought on sleep and how it [relates to training our brain](/_posts/tech/2025-05-13-Sleep-changes-our-architecture.md)
- by pitching app to many people about app idea, realized how badly people are addicted to inaction

## Where/How did I implement it

- Output
    - integrated with new backend dashboard
    - analytics, efficient calculations
    - logbook - better UX on the productivity data
    - settings, fonts, colors and final touches
- Trained first interation of artis model for cats
    - failed for gaussian lines/edges based generation
    - grayscale generation working better than expected
    - dataset augmentation improved model accuracy for worse outlines

## Any memorable moments of the week

- completed pantheon, it is really good
- spotlight presentation was a banger
- played heist games online with sanskar and shank, super fun
