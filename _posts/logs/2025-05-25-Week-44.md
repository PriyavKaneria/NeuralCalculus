## What I pre-planned

- artis
    - rethink on model architecture, try bigger models
- Output
    - polish
    - widgets
    - notification system

## What new did I learn

- how ios and android widgets work
- working of fiLM layers, better image generation models
- Google I/O made me learn very basics of diffusion based text models
- image generation is not an easy problem, atleast not intuitive right now

## Where/How did I implement it

- Output
    - notification system work, refine and fix
    - major bug fixes regarding storage of raw data
        - migrated to partial file based storage
    - onboarding refined, permissions etc
- Trained v2 and v3 of artis model for cats
    - fiLM layer made standard generation more robust but failed for simple deviations
    - complete redesign using
        - style encoder transformer
        - CNN based spatial planning
        - Adaptive generation U-Net
    - closer to goal, hand drawn and custom outline look a little like cat sometimes
        - but for actual usecase, not really there
        - unable to understand variation in same outline
        - dataset problem now I guess
