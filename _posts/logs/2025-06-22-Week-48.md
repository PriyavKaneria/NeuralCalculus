## What I pre-planned

- introspector
    - identify plan for creating god context
    - anyhow make the base context that actually makes sense

## What new did I learn

- [how diffusion models like actually work](https://youtu.be/Fk2I6pa6UeA)
    - image generation and it's relation with uniform RNG and PDF translations
- [sheafs, sheafification and some random set math](https://youtu.be/p2bFLG_Q7Lo)
- processing using LLMs individually in in many cases faster that building a system to generalize a solution

## Where/How did I implement it

- pitched some crazy ideas to l3 and now I have to prove myself
- discussed new plans for introspector, implemented them
    - got first context and personal data analysis
- implemented designs and thought of plans for achieving the near impossible feat that I pitched at work
