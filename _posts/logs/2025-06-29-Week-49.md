## What I pre-planned

- record and edit clips for output demo video
- think about what next with the projects and priorities
- introspector
    - use and test god context
    - implement basic mcp server for local vector search
- learn how to blow the shankh

## What new did I learn

- building mcp server is easy
- you can just talk to people (kavan iykyk)
- learnt how to peel and eat a cactus pear
- shooting shots was easy once the plan was made, editing is tricky
- understood the trick behind blowing a shankh, and also how it works

## Where/How did I implement it

- built [vector search anything](https://github.com/PriyavKaneria/vector-search-anything-mcp) (mcp server for local sqlite db mcp server with ollama)
- shot clips for output demo video at home
- immediate presentation plan at work for interns
- introspector
    - used vector search but did not get good results
    - used ollama openwebui knowledge rag but that too was not satisfactory
    - god context is not being followed by models as system prompt

## Any memorable moments of the week

- trek at Abhapara Hill station (Barda dungar), Bhanwad (10km super fun)
- met jimil
