- unfollow chunk (pos ratio)

- [put some thoughts from a few years ago to a blog](_posts/life/2025-07-02-Everything-is-a-currency.md)
- one shotting scripts using claude is reliable
- gemini cli is good enough
- how to peel and eat a cactus pear
- playing shankh for longer and breath control

## Where/How did I implement it

- Xanthium progress going great
    - gemini is good at implementing well defined features
    - relying on stack overflow is no longer reliable due to dead developer community
- me and father revived a 35yr old tabla dayaan

## Any memorable moments of the week

- 1 yr work anniversary
- fun with cousins at ahmd
- repaired and greased jhula with father which is now more silent than your skills
