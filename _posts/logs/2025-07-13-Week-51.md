## What I pre-planned

- work on Xanthium
    - proper working vector search
    - implement tag management
    - folder management
    - auto tagging
    - update on X
- Output demo video editing
- revive docucap?

## What new did I learn

- understood how vector search actually works (hnsw indexes)
- [input parameters](https://www.megaputer.com/mastering-language-models-a-deep-dive-into-input-parameters/) and its effects on llms (temp, top p/k, penalties)
- [reciprocal rank fusion](https://motherduck.com/blog/search-using-duckdb-part-3/) and hybrid reranking using fts+bm25 on vector embeddings

## Where/How did I implement it

- Xanthium progress going great
    - [basic vector search in duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vss#inserts-updates-deletes-and-re-compaction)
    - [implemented rrf with fts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phg91R_RLLE) in duckdb
    - tag management complete + individual tweet tagging
    - folder management partial
    - auto tagging complete and started processing (~17hrs)
- Output demo video
    - editing going good, satisfied
    - this time able to cook faster than last time
    - 60% video is edited

## Any memorable moments of the week

- getting good at football (defending)
- grok 4 and tokenbender follow
- started a community as a first step
- actually working vector search on tweets felt great
