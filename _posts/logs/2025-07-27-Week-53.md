## What new did I learn

- more in-depth understanding of each step in stitching images and parameter fine-tuning
    - orb, sift, feature detection algorithms
    - current sota and implementations
- lambda calculus [basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVA8Nj6HEo) and [diagrams](https://risingentropy.com/tag/lambda-calculus/)
- n8n automations
