- vibe coded [hiddenmotion.priyavkaneria.com](https://hiddenmotion.priyavkaneria.com) to showcase [how cool](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1951277318288322851) frame difference based motion detection is
- [launched trailer](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1951909079678607809) for Output, made it's own twitter account
- docucap pipeline was successful
    - was able to stitch images without overlap using 3 step pipeline
        - create panorama using calibration images
        - identify camera adjustments for 3 base images and save them
        - use those adjustments for ultra fast no-overlap stitching

## Any memorable moments of the week

- 40km cycling to Texas rocks valley, loved it
