## What I pre-planned

- docucap
    - figure out powering circuit
    - order components
    - 3d model for v0.2
- Output
    - requested features implement
    - deep thinking

## What new did I learn

- how [boost convertors work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNpsofY4-U) (it is magical), also ram pumps are cool
- gpt 5 is I guess peak of one-shotting fuddu tasks and trial websites
- made dosa for the first time and it went really well
- probably getting better at onshape, modelled base of v0.2 in 2hrs
- nordic chips are cool (tiny solar panels)

## Where/How did I implement it

- had coffee late night accidentaly and got visions of Output app future
    - I was thinking about this since few weeks but solved it in a night
- [brainstormed](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1953429607543157116) and noted down compelte flow of new personalized Output productivity experience
- identified and ordered boost converter, new espcam and lens and lots of small good stuff
- soldered and implemented basic powering circuit but probably missing out on the first umnf, might need capacitor
- Output features were vibecoded by grok 4

## Any memorable moments of the week

- rakshabandhan <3, lucky to be with sister
- sukhjinder farewell, sad cuz now I have no one to talk nerd at work
    - tho happy for him for moving to US
