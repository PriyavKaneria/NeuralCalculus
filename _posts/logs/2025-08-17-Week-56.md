## What I pre-planned

- docucap
    - still figuring out powering as lipo battery not having enough juice (current)
- Output
  - implement new personalized onboarding
- home work
  - tax of whole family
  - mails clean
- enjoy mini vacation, introspect

## What new did I learn

- docucap
  - in-depth about PSRAM, why a working ESP stopped working and [how did I resolve](/_posts/tech/2025-08-11-PSRAM-errors-in-ESP32-Cam.md) it after lot of debugging
  - got new powering plan ready but it requires a lot more parts and juice to power all 4 esp
  - reimplemented the esp code for simple yet high quality image streams with minimum loss
- discussed a real ton about goals and life productivity with sister
  - got clarity on purpose, non-purpose, waste actions
  - how everyone has a threshold acceptable ratio of these 3
  - do people need rest or they just feel like they do and it is laziness in disguise
- google meet app package name is tachyon which is cool
- started learning tracktion waveform DAW for making music mashups

## Where/How did I implement it

- added all components to cart but did not place order as battery is out of stock
- started fafo music mixing on tracktion waveform, failed miserably but got back at making something less ambitious
- Output onboarding partially implemented by grok 4, finishing touches by me
  - initial onboarding in progress, but base component is there
- hackathon idea discussion was fruitful and we might have something cool to cook

## Any memorable moments of the week

- another long cycle ride to osman sagar (45km)
  - this time at faster pace, really beatiful on independence day
- janmashtami special dinner - meethi puri and fried chilli with curd
