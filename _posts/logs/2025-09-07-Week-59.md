## What I pre-planned

- docucap
  - fine-tuning parameters for actual stitching using all 4
- work on samaya
  - Mahabharata extraction
- lock in at work stuff cuz it is interesting

## What new did I learn

- eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher is an actual word for german egg crackers
- found an [amazing blog](https://bharatbhumika.blogspot.com/2014/08/puranic-chronology-of-india.html) deep dive into the actual timeline of hindu mythology
- i need to make sure to upskill myself in relevant fields because you never know when the market forces everyone to catch up to you
- lots of functional knowledge in work
  - about vision and ongoing, future works
  - how complicated resource management solutions work
  - database, middleware and scaling them for huge customers

## Where/How did I implement it

- tested complete calibration pipeline on the esp modules
  - requires a lot of fine-tuning params for faster and more accurate stitching
- write some nice blogs on [care](/_posts/life/2025-09-06-Why-you-should-do-what-you-want.md) and [success](/_posts/life/2025-09-07-The-tree-of-success.md)
- got some nice progress at work
  - mapped out complete years of complicated code into a graph for teams to vizualize
  - lots of brainstorming and in-depth architecture discussions on necessary usecases
- started working on samaya for a very robust base (complete vibe code attempt)
  - failed miserably using gpt5
  - even grok could not go back to something better
  - started from scratch for single file complete book data extraction
    - this will take time but is straight forward
    - had to scrap 1 full day of llm analysis due to bad json parsing

## Any memorable moments of the week

- new pfp on X
- completed modern family, very much fun and memorable
