## What I pre-planned

- diwali celebrate
- Output onboarding work
- Samaya
  - hierarchical tree creation improve
- AI wearable
  - get mvp working of audio transfer over ble
- docucap
  - refine pipeline to work for anchor images

## What new did I learn

- lots of indepth hardware details
  - PCM and other audio modulation formats
  - BLE and NUS, intervals, MTU, GATT, UART etc
- Bluetooth and its states

## Where/How did I implement it

- man hardware is difficult
  - for ai wearable had to start from complete low level as what I want to do is not a standard thing
- built an editor for Samaya hierarchy tree, did reprocessing
  - finally got a decently mapped tree
- completed the book "steal like an artist" by Austin Klean
  - it is really good and i related with almost all the points in it
- docucap
  - approach was wrong, I just have to get the camera params and use them for stitching anchors
  - will need a good callibration phase tho for a big panorama to refer camera from
- output onboarding little progress, not much motivation honestly

## Any memorable moments of the week

- craziest diwali with random rich guy who was a childhood friend of my sisters college friends fathers mothers husband
  - yeah we were almost like family
- chatgpt wrapper post was good
