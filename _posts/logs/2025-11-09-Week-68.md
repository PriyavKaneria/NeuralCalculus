## What I pre-planned

- ai wearable
  - take insipiration from existing firmware
  - downgrade to older sdk and APIs for compatibility
  - complete basic audio transfer implementation
- midi detect
  - improve frequency detection and midi conversion

## What new did I learn

- very interesting [recursive copy](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1985781161134809212?s=20) command almost filled up my entire ssd
- saying hello on the phone was started by graham bell (inventor) himself and made its way to all languages
- laplace transforms are so freaking awesome
- how codec work (a little)
  - complexity, VBR, sample rate, sample sizes

## Where/How did I implement it

- a lot of work stuff, somehow I have responsibilities for a lot of projects
- locked in at the firmware for the entire week (after work hours)
  - reimplemented the transfer system from scratch using purely callbacks and minimal threads
  - identified proper priorities for threads (pusher > codec > mic)
  - got gibberish but succesful audio transfer in 2 days this week
  - realized complexity was not able to catch up, celt wasn't working for some reason
  - implemented low complexity silk approach and got it working
  - somehow wrote a firmware that can send audio data over BLE in REALTIME without packet loss at decent quality
- after the firware success, improved the frequency detection algo
  - identified smoothing was causing bad intermediate notes, which after fixing performs much better

## Any memorable moments of the week

- my site priyavkaneria.com has like 90k visitors in a week
- watched "500 days of summer" and it is a beautiful movie
- bought a LOT of groceries (ready for some weight gain)
- platform 65 idea of serving food on train is cool (quality mid)
