## What I pre-planned

- ai wearable
  - offline lightweight transcription ofr en, hi and gu
  - language detection model train
  - research of further usecases, problems, graph and plan
  - talk more about it
- build the lego technic set

## What new did I learn

- different open source models in stt space
- ai4bharat has done good work, but again just bare minimum to stay relevent
  - most models are already out of date or not easily usable or working
- supply chain attacks ([npm - shai hulud](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1992926693808599289?s=20))
- prompt injection based credential leaking using agentic tools like antigravity
- making stateful animations is actually good using rive
  - tried and learnt rive
- powerpoint is as awesome as it can [ever be](https://youtu.be/w5QSVhgrqVE?si=q7tAeBTMmQqQdUNI)

## Where/How did I implement it

- ai wearable
  - language detection model trained succesfully
    - actual inference [accuracy is not good](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1993294355495288890?s=20), possible overfitting
  - whisper is not that fast and good locally for indic languages
  - tried multiple alternatives and finally used vosk
- tried rive but exports are paid and not worth the effort for that price
  - stuck to simplistic animations and flow for now in priority

## Any memorable moments of the week

- ran 6.25 km for aditi's 25th birthday on 25 nov 2025 (25th strava run)
- built 80% of the redbull racing lego tecnic f1 set with sis, kartik and aditi
  - it was so much fun, never spent an entire day doing one thing and enjoying it still
- long calls with homies
