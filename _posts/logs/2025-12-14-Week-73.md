## What I pre-planned

- ai wearable
  - hinglish transcriptions accuracy increase
  - run transcriptions in background
  - experiment with memories
- organizing a fun event at work
- edit timelapse of lego and post

## What new did I learn

- antigravity has single handedly made me atleast 10x productive
- Xiaomi makes cars. and I mean some really fkin awesome cars man! [love it](https://x.com/_diginova/status/1998043043543548171?s=20)
- our subconsious has like full access to storage drive but our consiousness can just access the RAM
- a lot of founders are selling before building and doubling down on selling even more
  - as more people get access to ai - ideas + execution can beat distribution in the long term. also distribution can be bought with money
- twitter lists can be pinned like feeds (yeah never realised)

## Where/How did I implement it

- ai wearable
  - hinglish transcriptions achieved and optimized even
  - batch transcribed hours of my personal recordings for processing further
  - decided to post annoucement soon
  - recordings page improved and optimized
- made a nice timelapse edit with my current fav earworm and posted
- felt sick so just watched a lot of content on youtube
  - [how calculating new velocity before position can drastically improve long time scale gravity simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCg3aXn5F3M)
  - [some really interesting thoughts on UX and design in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fZTOjd_bOQ)
