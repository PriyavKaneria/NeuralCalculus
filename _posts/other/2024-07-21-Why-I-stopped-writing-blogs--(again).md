Did you notice the gap in writing out my thoughts between Jan-2024 to June-2024?

I did not stop writing out my thoughts. I just started using twitter. like how it was meant to be used. was worried about my instagram addiction, but it's solved now. Because I have a twitter addiction now. Anyway, I'm fine with this one. It's at least not brain-rot and helping me gain an audience (distribution).

But it's not good. long form writing is still the better way to write for me and I'll have to solve this. I'll figure out a way to disconnect this private repo. Well, once I have my domain (i'm getting my first salary pretty soon!) I'll probably make this public anyway. Still I need a way to write my thoughts, save them to these articles without having a code editor.

Just wait for 5 mins, I'll figure it out...

a website with push access to my github.. hmm.. have to have the simplest but most difficult auth in there...
... let me ask claude once

got it. claude could not help me much, but just 5 mins of boredom, thinking about how making my own watch relates to this... got the idea

Cool I let claude do the coding and all, with sveltekit. and it's done

I have a [website](https://neuralcalculus.netlify.app/) ready. I can authenticate myself, and write my blog (which auto saves) which then can be pushed directly to github! Also this article, was written in local, but pushed via BlogAnywhere.

Awesome. Now I'll be back with some nuggets of wisdom once in a while
